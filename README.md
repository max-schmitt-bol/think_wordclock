## Features
This project includes the following features:
- Arduino Nano as a microcontroller
- 114 NeoPixel LEDs WS2812b as Zic-Zac matrix starting from top left  
- RTC module DS3231
- DCF77 receiver for German clock signal
- 7 different color modes (switched when turned off/on within 10 seconds after startup)
- light sensor to adjust the brightness of LEDs to the environment
- DCF77 signal quality measurement on every startup and display on LED matrix (see description below)

## DCF77 Signal quality measurement

I added a signal measurement feature for the DCF77 receiver. The signal quality is now also displayed at each startup with the LEDs:
1. (during measurement) top left LED flashes blue, 
2. (after measurement) red/green the signal quality is shown as a bar for 2 seconds (10 leds = good, 1 led = bad)
